SHORT DESCRIPTION
    PSHealthZ is an HTTP listener written in PowerShell that executes Operation Validation Framework (OVF)
    tests and returns results using a simple REST API

LONG DESCRIPTION
    Basic HTTP(S) listener that executes Operation Validation Framework (https://github.com/PowerShell/Operation-Validation-Framework)
    (OVF) tests that are present on the given system and returns results using a simple REST API.
    This is an implementation of the [Health Endpoint Monitoring Pattern](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn589789.aspx) using PowerShell.

    The Operation Validation Framework is a PowerShell module used to execute Pester tests that validate the operation
    of a system rather than test the behavior of code. This could mean running tests that validate certain Windows services
    are running and IIS is responding on port 443.

    Normally, OVF/Pester are executed locally on the system. PSHealthZ provides a way to remotely execute these OVF/Pester tests
    and return the test results via a REST API.

    When monitoring an application from a central monitoring platform, this enables that platform to only be concerned with hitting
    a known endpoint URL and interpreting the results. The monitoring platform no longer needs to know how to monitor every application
    in the environment as all monitoring logic has moved onto the system. This greatly simplifies the architecture of a monitoring
    platform and can help move the responsibility of monitoring to application teams who know their application best.

EXAMPLES
    Setup a basic listener using default values. This will create a new listener on port 1938 using the path /health.

        $listener = Start-HealthZListener -PassThru

    To validate that the listener responds, run the following:

        Invoke-RestMethod -Uri 'http://localhost:1938/health'

    To get all currently running listeners (you can run more than one at a time provided they listen on different ports) run:
        $listeners | Get-HealthZListener

    To stop a listener, run:
        $listener | Stop-HealhZListener
        or
        Stop-HealhZListener -Id $listener.Id
        or
        Get-HealthZListener | Stop-HealthZListener

AUTHENTICATION
    It is best that the PSHealthZ endpoint be protected from unauthenticated requests. To accomplish that, you can setup a secure token that
    must be provided either in the query string or as an HTTP header. This ensures that only authenticated REST calls will be accepted.

    Example:
    $token = New-HealthZToken
    Start-HealthZListener -Token $token

    Call REST API using token in header
    $headers = @{
        token = $token
    }
    Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:1938/health?module=*" -Headers $headers

    Call REST API using token in query string
    Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:1938/health?module=*&token=$token"

SSL
    It is recommended that the listener use SSL. To accomplish that, a certificate must already be installed in the LocalMachine certificate store
    and you must have the thumbprint available.

    Run the following to setup the listener to use a locally installed certificate:
        $thumbprint = '<your certificate thumbprint>'
        $listener = Start-HealthZListener -Port 8443 -UseSSL -CertificateThumbprint $thumbprint -PassThru
